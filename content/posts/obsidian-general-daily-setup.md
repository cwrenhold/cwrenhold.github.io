    A guide to setting up Obsidian for daily and general use, including managing daily tasks, long term tasks, and general knowledge.

Obsidian is a powerful tool for note-taking and knowledge management. It's also a fantastic tool for managing your daily, and long term tasks. In this post, I'm going to walk through how I use Obsidian to manage my daily tasks, and how I use it to manage my long term tasks, as well as keeping track of general knowledge around my work.

## Daily Notes

To start with, let's start with the daily notes. There is a Core plugin called Daily Notes, which comes enabled by default with Obsidian. This plugin allows you to create a new note for each day, and these can be created in a structures manner so they are easy to find. To do this, you can go to the settings for the Daily Notes plugin, and set the date format for the notes. Personally, I use the following format:

```text
YYYY/MM - MMMM/YYYY-MM-DD dddd
```

This puts all of my notes into a folder for the year, then a folder for the month (using the number of the month as well as the full name), and then the note itself is named with the full date, including the day of the week. This makes it easy to find the notes for a specific day, and also makes it easy to find the notes for a specific month.

All of my daily notes are then stored in their only folder, "Daily Notes" so that they are easy to find, and separate from my other notes.

The next part of the daily notes configuration which I would recommend is setting up a template for these notes. This allows you to create a format for your daily notes, and then when you create a new daily note, that template will be used as a starting point to create the note. To do this, you first create your template. I've done this by creating a note called "Daily Note Template", and then I've added the following content to that note:

```markdown
# Carry over from Yesterday
- [ ] 

# To Do
- [ ] 
```

This means that my notes are broken down automatically into two sets of tasks:

- Carry over from yesterday - this is for anything which wasn't completed the previous day
- To Do - this is for anything which I need to do today as is starting today
